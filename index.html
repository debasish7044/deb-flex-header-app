 <h2>Welcome to responsive header with flexbox</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the website. If you're here, you're likely looking to find random words. Random Word Generator is the perfect tool to help you do this. While this tool isn't a word creator, it is a word generator that will generate random words for a variety of activities or uses. Even better, it allows you to adjust the parameters of the random words to best fit your needs.</p>

  <p>You also have the option of choosing the number of syllables of the words or the word length of the randomized words. There are also options to further refine by choosing "less than" or "greater than" options for both syllables and word length. Again, if you leave the space blank, the complete list of randomized words will be used. Finally, you can choose between standard text or cursive words. The cursive words will all be in cursive using cursive letters.</p>
